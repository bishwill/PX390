    32         Changed the output of the main function
               from double to int because the main
               function must always return an output
               of type int

    51         Don't know what to put here

    98         Function sin() was called but it hasn't
               been defined due to the fact that the
               math library has not been included. To
               fix, I have added the line
               #include <math.h> to the program so sin()
               is defined.

    109        Function cos() was called but it hasn't
               been defined due to the fact that the
               math library has not been included. To
               fix, I have added the line
               #include <math.h> to the program so cos()
               is defined.

    96-97      Within the if statement, the expressions
               used = instead of ==. This is an
               assignment rather than a logical
               expression so it should not be used in an
               if statement. Changing each = to a == will
               fix the issue.

    110        ctime was declared but it was not given
               an initial value. Therefore when it was
               incremented further in the program, it
               did not have a value to increment. To fix
               it, I set the value to be 0.0 when
               the variable is declared.

    115-122    malloc(nx) --> malloc(sizeof(double) * nx)       

    137, 154, 172  for loop changed to interior points [1, nx-1] 

    152-153    Changed 2*dt to dt.

    158, 160 175, 177   Changed + D to - D 

    168        Formula was incorrect for rotation matrix

    182-183    Changed from vts1 and vts2 to vn and vc respectively


    197-199    Removed the & when freeing memory as it is
               not required.


    199        Removed free(vts1) and free(vts2)
